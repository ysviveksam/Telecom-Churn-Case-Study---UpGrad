**Business Case Name**

The business case is about a telecom company facing the problem of customer churn. The company wants to identify the customers who are likely to churn in the near future and implement measures to retain them. The company has provided a dataset containing various customer attributes such as usage patterns, account information, and demographics. The objective of the analysis is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict churn and provide insights into factors that contribute to churn. The insights and recommendations can then be used by the company to design and implement targeted retention strategies.

**Problem Statement**

The telecommunications industry is known for its high customer churn rates. Customer churn refers to the situation where a customer stops using a company's product or service. Churn can be due to various reasons such as poor customer service, better offerings from competitors, or financial reasons. In the telecommunications industry, churn can be particularly detrimental to business as it is highly competitive, and acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. Therefore, it is essential for telecom companies to understand the reasons behind customer churn and take necessary steps to retain their customers.

In this business case, we will analyze the customer churn data of a telecom company and identify the factors that lead to churn. The main objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify the customers who are at a high risk of churn so that the company can take proactive steps to retain them. By doing so, the company can reduce its churn rate, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase its revenue.

The problem needs to be addressed because high churn rates can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line. Losing customers to competitors can result in lost revenue and increased costs associated with acquiring new customers. It can also damage the company's reputation and make it less attractive to potential customers. Therefore, identifying the factors that lead to churn and taking necessary steps to retain customers is crucial for the long-term success of the company.


**Approach and Methodology**

The approach and methodology used to solve the problem involved the following steps:

Data collection: The first step was to collect data on the customers' usage patterns, demographics, and account information, as well as information on whether they had churned or not.

Data cleaning and preprocessing: The collected data was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies and missing values. Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and feature engineering were applied to prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): The EDA was performed to understand the distribution of various features and their impact on the target variable. Visualizations and statistical analysis were used to gain insights into the data.

Model building: Various classification models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost were built to predict churn. The models were fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search and cross-validation.

Model evaluation: The models were evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. The best-performing model was selected based on the evaluation metrics.

Dealing with imbalanced classes: Techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE were used to handle imbalanced classes in the data.
Model interpretation: The best-performing model was interpreted to gain insights into the factors that contribute to churn. Feature importance scores were used to identify the most important factors.

Recommendations: Based on the insights gained from the analysis, recommendations were made to the telecom company on how to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

Deployment: The final model was deployed to a production environment so that it could be used to predict churn in real-time.

**Data Sources**

The data used for analysis was obtained from the publicly available datasets from the Kaggle platform. The dataset contained information about the telecom customers, their usage patterns, and demographic information. It was collected from a telecom company over a period of time, and had information about churned as well as non-churned customers. The dataset was provided in the form of a CSV file, The file was then loaded into the Jupyter notebook environment for analysis.

**Data Pre-processing**

In the given business case, the following data pre-processing techniques were used:

Handling missing values: The missing values were identified and imputed using the mean or median values for the respective columns, based on the data distribution and context.

Feature scaling: Feature scaling was done to bring all the features to a common scale. Standardization was used to scale the features.

Feature engineering: New features were created based on the existing ones. For example, the total charges were derived by multiplying monthly charges with tenure.

These techniques were used to prepare the data for further analysis and modeling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step to understand the data and gain insights. In this business case, the following EDA techniques were used:

1) Univariate analysis: A summary of each feature's distribution was obtained, including measures such as mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. This allowed us to identify outliers and check if the data followed any specific distribution.
2) Bivariate analysis: We examined the relationship between the target variable (churn) and the other features to determine which ones had a significant impact on the target variable.
3) Multivariate analysis: A correlation matrix was used to determine the correlation between the features. We also looked at the relationship between the features and the target variable.
4) Data visualization: Various plots such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps were used to visually analyze the data.

The EDA helped us gain insights into the data and identify patterns that were used in feature engineering and model building. We were able to identify the most important features that impacted customer churn, which helped us in building an effective classification model.

**Model Building**

The data was split into training and testing sets, and various classification models were built using the training set to predict the target variable. The following classification models were built:

1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
4) XGBoost
5) Neural Network

The hyperparameters of these models were tuned using techniques such as GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. The performance of these models was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

**Model Evaluation**

Various metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the classification models built to predict the outcome. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

1) Accuracy: It measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions made. It is calculated as (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN), where TP is true positives, TN is true negatives, FP is false positives, and FN is false negatives.
2) Precision: It measures the proportion of true positives out of the total number of positive predictions made. It is calculated as TP / (TP + FP).
3) Recall: It measures the proportion of true positives out of the total number of actual positives in the dataset. It is calculated as TP / (TP + FN).
4) AUC: It is the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

These metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the classification models and to choose the best-performing model for the business case.

**Dealing with Imbalanced Classes**

In the business case, the target variable was found to be imbalanced, with a majority class of customers not churning. To address this issue, various techniques were employed to balance the dataset and improve model performance.

One technique used was oversampling, where the minority class was oversampled by randomly duplicating instances of the minority class until it reaches the desired balance with the majority class. Another technique used was undersampling, where instances from the majority class were randomly removed to balance the dataset.

In addition, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was also employed, which creates new synthetic instances of the minority class by interpolating between existing instances. This technique helps to improve the diversity of the minority class instances and improves model performance.

The performance of each technique was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC to select the best approach for the classification model.

**Results and Recommendations**

The results obtained from the analysis show that the telecom company has a significant churn rate of customers, which is affecting their revenue and growth. Various classification models were built and evaluated to predict the churn outcome, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost.

The best performing model was the XGBoost classifier, which had an accuracy of 0.85 and an AUC of 0.90. The feature importance analysis also showed that some features, such as total recharge amount and call duration, had a high impact on the churn outcome.

To address the high churn rate, several recommendations were made, including:

1) Launch targeted marketing campaigns to retain high-value customers by offering them personalized and relevant promotions based on their usage patterns.
2) Improve the quality of customer service by reducing the average response time for customer queries and complaints.
3) Improve network connectivity and service quality to reduce customer dissatisfaction.
4) Identify and address issues related to billing and payment to improve customer satisfaction.
5) Launch loyalty programs to incentivize and retain long-term customers.

Overall, the analysis showed that the telecom company can significantly reduce its churn rate by implementing the above recommendations and improving its overall customer experience.

**Future Work**

Some future work that can be done to improve the analysis and recommendations are:

1) Collect more data: The analysis can be improved by collecting more data, especially in cases where the dataset is imbalanced or the number of features is limited.
2) Fine-tune existing models: Fine-tuning existing models by adjusting the hyperparameters can lead to improved accuracy and performance.
3) Experiment with new models: There are various machine learning models that can be experimented with to improve the accuracy of the predictions. For example, deep learning models can be used for better performance on image or text data.
4) Explore new features: Feature engineering is an important step in machine learning. The addition of new features can help in better predicting the target variable.
5) Consider domain knowledge: Domain knowledge can be used to inform the feature engineering process and improve the accuracy of the models.
6) Continuous monitoring: It is important to continuously monitor the performance of the models and update them as needed. This can be done by implementing a feedback loop that continuously evaluates the models and updates them based on new data or changes in the business environment.
